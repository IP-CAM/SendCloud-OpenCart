Check the SendCloud Extension's settings. The public key and/or secret key may be blank. If both settings are not blank check if your API keys are correct in the
`SendCloud Panel <https://panel.sendcloud.nl/>`_.

The orders canâ€™t be transported to SendCloud. This occurs when you don't have a suitable shipping method configured in your SendCloud account.
You should contact the `SendCloud support team <contact@sendcloud.nl>`_ if you think that you're not having access to the correct shipping methods.
